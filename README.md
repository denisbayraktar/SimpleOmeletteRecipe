### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a better understanding of responsive web design, which refers to the ability of web pages to be resized or have certain sections hidden or shown based on screen size across different devices.

Furthermore, I delved deeper into the concept of the box model in CSS. CSS treats each HTML element as a box, and layout is achieved by scaling the dimensions of these boxes. Through this project, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of the box model concept, including terms like border (edge), padding (filling), and margin (outer space).

Additionally, I learned to target specific elements for styling using selectors.
